This isn't fleshed out as much but I realized that if you start at the corner,
there are only 2 other places where you can go. However, if you start from the
center or literally anywhere else, there can be a minimum of 3 moves and a max
of 8 moves. Therefore, that means that if you start at the center, you may run of
space to go. However, if you start at the corner, there aren't that many places
to go so you wouldn't lose much. If you go to the corner, there's a 50% chance
that you picked the right beginning, whereas for the center, you have a 1/8 or 
12.5% of picking the right first move.
