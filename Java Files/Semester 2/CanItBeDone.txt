~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A method to make an O(n) algorithm which can search through a 2D array effectively
is to start at the bottom left corner and move right if the array number is larger
than the desired number. If the array number is smaller than the desired number, 
move up the array and repeat what was mentioned previously. If the array contains
the desired number, return 1, else return 0, signifying that the array is void of
that particular number.
