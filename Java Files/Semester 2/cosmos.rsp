Response to
Episode 2 - "Some of the Things That Molecules Do"
@-------------------------------------------------
< 
 *There are a lot of dogs...
 *People hunted and gathered but then they started
 to do agriculture
 *Humans train dogs by giving food and doing what 
 they want
 *Dogs evolved through "artifical selection"
 *A million proteins can fit in a single grain of 
 sand
 *100 billion parts called "atoms" in a molecule
 *Unwinding protein breaks it apart
 *It messes up sometimes, now called a mutation
 *Natural Selection, environment chooses the 
 good mutations
 *Charles Darwin said that an individual doesn't
 evolve, but the population does
 *The tree and Neil are long lost cousins, as well
 as butterflies, wolves, mushrooms, sharks, bacteria,
 and sparrows
 *Some parts vary and no one else in the universe
 have the same genetic code
 *Prevailing thought was the work of a divine being
 *Eye requires a cornea, lens, iris, muscles and a 
 lot more
 *The eye can't be something of random mutation
 *For billions of years, nothing could see
 *Mutation caused light sensing bacteria
 *Flee intense light
 *Became concentrated in one place, proto-eye
 *A dimple allows the flatworm to see light vs 
 shadows
 *A lens allowed sharpness and light to come in
 *Eyes are from originally the water
 *Eyes couldn't see through the air like the water
 *Eyes were no longer as good as in the water
 *All of bio doesn't make sense without evolution
 *There were many great extinctions that caused
 millions of species to die
 *Supervolcanoes destroyed the trilobites
 *The Great Dying - 9/10 of all species dead
 *Took more than 10 million years to recover
 *An animal can go anywhere without dying (WOW!!!)
 *Water bears, tartigrades, survived all the mass
 extinctions
 *Titan is the only other place where it rains (in
 the solar system)
 *Lakes dry up and rain down continuously
 *Water made of methane and ethane
 *Landscape is made of water ice
 *Can life be in hydrocarbon water?
 *The only shame is pretend we have all the answers
