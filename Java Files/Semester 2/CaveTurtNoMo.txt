Hand 2 distinct people half a deck of cards. They will in turn hand another 2
distinct people the cards that they received, each with approximately a quarter
of the original deck. They then pass half of what they have to another distinct
person, and the rest to another distinct person. Continue until the most basic
number of elements have been reached (everyone has 1 card). Now, there should
be n people with 1 card, n being the number of cards in the original deck. From
here, people should go up the chain, comparing their values. The two lowest tier
people compare and put their cards in ascending order and hand it to the person
who orginally gave them the cards. That person compares to the other person who
recieved cards from their "supervisor" - the person above them in rank who
handed them the cards. They put the cards that they received in order and send
it to their "supervisors". The "supervisors" compare those cards with the
corresponding person from their "supervisors". Those cards are put in order.
This continues up the chain until the person who originally handed out the cards
are given the cards back, sorted.

In the end, this can be shown as a branching tree where each branch has two
branches coming down until all branches terminate at branches where there are
only 1 card. Going up that branch from the very bottom will give a sorted
list.
