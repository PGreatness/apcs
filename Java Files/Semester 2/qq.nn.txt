In the case of a 2x2 board, it isn't possible as occupying any space by one queen
immediately renders the other spaces unavailable to a queen. In the case of a 3x3
board, two queens can be placed before a conflict arises on the last queen since 
the only available space would definitely threaten an existing queen. For the case
of a 4x4 board, a solution can be found since queens can be placed at 1 from the
top on the leftmost column, the bottom of the 2nd column, the very top of the 3rd,
and 3rd from the top in the last column. For a 5x5 board, the same pattern from
the 4x4 can be made and then putting the final queen on the very bottom of the
5th column. A 6x6 is harder and it took me a longer time to do but it is possible.
The first queen is 2 from the top at the first column, the 2nd is 2 below that on
the next column, and the 3rd is 2 below that on the 3rd column. 4th is on the very
top of the 4th column, 5th is 2 below the one in the 4th column but in the 5th
column, and the final queen is 2 below the 5th but in the 5th column. I haven't
been able to find it out for the 7 or 8 and it may not exist.
