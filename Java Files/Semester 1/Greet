/*As opposed to most other programming languages that I know so far, Java seems to be more complex. Python is simple with some definition, a line of code, and then calling the code again. The same goes for Scheme but for Java, you have to state a class, that it's public. Basically, a lot of stuff to make sure the exact thing that you want to happen happens.*/
