/*As opposed to most other programming languages that I know so far, Java seems to be more complex. Python is simple with some definition, a line of code, and  then calling the code again. The same goes for Scheme but for Java, you have to  state a class, that it's public. Basically, a lot of stuff to make sure the    exact thing that you want to happen happens. Python seems to be a more primitive version of Java. Not treading on any feet here, but the complexity of Java 
makes it seem like a language only for pros.*/
