/***
  driver for class Coin
  ~~~ SUGGESTED WORKFLOW: ~~~
  1. Compile this file and run.
  2. Move the "TOP" line below the first statement. 
  (with cursor at beginning of TOP line, C-k C-k, DOWN, DOWN, C-y)
  3. Compile and run again. 
  4. Resolve errors 1 at a time until it works
  5. Repeat 2-4 until TOP meets BOTTOM
